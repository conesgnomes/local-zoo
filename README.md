  # _zoocyclopedia_

  #### Week 2 Final Project - JavaScript at Epicodus

  #### By **Connor Larsen, July 7, 2017**

  ## Description

  This is an application built with Angular2 for managing information about the animals in a zoo, allowing users to input an animal's species, name, age, diet, zoo location, number of needed caretakers, sex, one like and one dislike, and have that information displayed back to them. They are able to edit the animal's information after adding it to the list as well as filter animals by age.

  In future iterations of this app I would like to include:

  * Ability to add a photo of each animal
  * Ability to group animal by region of the world it originates
  * Ability to sort by diet (carnivores v. herbivores v. omnivores)
  * Ability to track males v. females of a species for mating
  * Ability to add a description on each species
  * Information on where the zoo received the animal from
